        "content": "Here are six high-quality debate questions that you can ask to the opposing side:\n\n1. According to the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which has been ratified by 182 countries, doesn't the tobacco industry's interference in public health policy-making, as evident in the 2019 Philip Morris International's lobbying efforts against tobacco control measures, underscore the need for a comprehensive ban on cigarettes, as proposed by our motion?\n\n2. Can the opposing side explain why, despite the well-documented health risks, including the 7 million annual fatalities attributed to tobacco consumption, as reported by the 2017 Global Youth Tobacco Survey, they still advocate for the continued sale and consumption of cigarettes, a product that clearly violates the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 3.4, which aims to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by one-third by 2030?\n\n3. In light of the success of Uruguay's tobacco control measures, which included plain packaging and increased taxes, resulting in a 22% decline in cigarette sales between 2005 and 2011, as reported by the Pan American Health Organization, isn't it time for governments worldwide to adopt a comprehensive approach to tobacco control, as proposed by our motion, rather than continuing to prioritize the interests of the tobacco industry?\n\n4. Doesn't the opposing side's stance on cigarettes contradict the principles enshrined in Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which recognizes the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and the obligation of states to ensure equal access to health care for all, including the millions of people addicted to cigarettes?\n\n6. Can the opposing side explain why they believe that the economic benefits of the tobacco industry outweigh the staggering economic costs of tobacco consumption, estimated to be over $1.4 trillion annually in healthcare expenditures and lost productivity, as reported by the 2017 Economic Costs of Tobacco Toolkit, and wouldn't a ban on cigarettes ultimately benefit economies worldwide?"

Doesn't the concept of \"one nation, one election\" undermine the principles of federalism, as enshrined in Article 1 of the Indian Constitution, which recognizes the sovereignty of states and their autonomy in matters of governance, and wouldn't a uniform election schedule compromise the unique needs and priorities of individual states?\n\n2. Can the opposing side explain how a \"one nation, the simultaneous elections would ensure the continuity of development projects, as claimed, when in reality, it would lead to a situation where newly elected governments would be saddled with the unfinished projects of their predecessors, as seen in the case of the 2014 Indian general elections, where the new government inherited unfinished projects from the previous government?\n\n3. In light of the experience of the 2019 elections in India, where the Election Commission of India spent a whopping \u20b950 billion on conducting the elections, wouldn't a \"one nation, one election\" framework lead to a significant increase in electoral expenditure, and wouldn't it be more prudent to allocate these resources to more pressing development needs, as education and healthcare?\n\n4. Doesn't the concept of \"one nation, one election\" ignore the diversity of Indian states, where different regions have different priorities, and wouldn't a uniform election schedule compromise the representation of regional interests, as seen in the case of the 2019 Jharkhand Assembly elections, where local issues took center stage?\n\n5. Can the opposing side explain how a simultaneous election schedule would address the issue of voter fatigue, as seen in the 2019 Indian general elections, where voter turnout declined in many states, and wouldn't a \"one nation, one election\" framework lead to a further decline in voter participation, thereby undermining the very fabric of Indian democracy?\n\n6. Doesn't the \"one nation, one election\" concept contradict the principles of democratic decentralization, as enshrined in the 73rd and 74th Amendments to the Indian Constitution, which empower local governments to take decisions on local issues, and wouldn't a uniform election schedule undermine the autonomy of panchayats and municipalities?"

As the global tobacco epidemic claims 7 million lives annually, with 80% of them living in low- and middle-income countries, as reported by the World Health Organization, doesn't the opposition's stance on cigarettes contradict the principles of social justice, and wouldn't a ban on cigarettes be a critical step towards protecting the health and well-being of the world's most vulnerable populations?\n\n2. Can the opposing side explain why, despite the overwhelming scientific evidence on the harmful effects of tobacco, they continue to advocate for the continued sale and consumption of cigarettes, which clearly violate Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which recognizes the right to a standard of living adequate for health and well-being?\n\n3. In light of the success of Australia's plain packaging law, which led to a 12.8% decline in smoking rates between 2012 and 2015, as reported by the Australian Government Department of Health, isn't it time for governments to adopt a comprehensive approach to tobacco control, including a ban on cigarettes, rather than continuing to prioritize the interests of the tobacco industry?\n\n4. Doesn't the opposing side's stance on cigarettes ignore the disproportionate impact of tobacco on low-income communities, who are more likely to be addicted to tobacco and suffer from tobacco-related illnesses, and wouldn't a ban on cigarettes be a critical step towards reducing health inequities and promoting health justice?\n\n5. Can the opposing side explain why, despite the tobacco industry's history of deceit and manipulation, as evident in the 2006 US District Court ruling against the tobacco industry for racketeering, they continue to trust the industry's claims on the effectiveness of self-regulation and wouldn't a ban on cigarettes be a necessary step towards protecting public health from the industry's harmful practices?\n\n6. Doesn't the continued sale and consumption of cigarettes undermine the global progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 3.4, which aims to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by one-third by 2030, and wouldn't a ban on cigarettes be a critical step towards accelerating progress towards the SDGs?"

Doesn't the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) have the potential to promote national integration and unity, as envisioned by Article 44 of the Indian Constitution, by providing a common set of laws for all citizens, and wouldn't its implementation be a critical step towards realizing the vision of a united and cohesive India?\n\n2. Can the opposing side explain why, despite the Supreme Court's repeated calls for a UCC, as seen in the 2017 Shayara Bano vs. Union of India judgment, they continue to advocate for the status quo, where personal laws often perpetuate discrimination and inequality, and wouldn't a UCC be a necessary step towards ensuring gender justice and equality?\n\n3. In light of the success of countries like Turkey and Tunisia, which have implemented secular and gender-neutral civil codes, isn't it time for India to follow suit and adopt a UCC that promotes modernity, secularism, and gender equality, and wouldn't this be a critical step towards realizing India's aspirations as a modern and developed nation?\n\n4. Doesn't the absence of a UCC perpetuate legal pluralism, where different religious communities are governed by their own personal laws, and wouldn't this lead to a situation where the rights and freedoms of citizens are determined by their religious identity, rather than their citizenship, as guaranteed by Article 14 of the Indian Constitution?\n\n5. Can the opposing side explain why, despite the All India Muslim Personal Law Board's (AIMPLB) admission that triple talaq is undesirable, they continue to advocate for the retention of this discriminatory practice, and wouldn't a UCC be a necessary step towards protecting the rights and dignity of Muslim women, as guaranteed by Article 15 of the Indian Constitution?\n\n6. Doesn't the implementation of a UCC have the potential to promote economic development and growth, by providing a common set of laws that facilitate ease of doing business, reduce legal uncertainty, and promote investment, and wouldn't this be a critical step towards realizing India's aspirations as a $5 trillion economy?"

Can the opposing side explain why, despite the success of simultaneous elections in states like Odisha, where the Biju Janata Dal government has implemented a synchronized election schedule, they continue to advocate for the status quo, and wouldn't a \"one nation, one election\" framework promote electoral reforms and improve the overall quality of democracy?\n\n6. Doesn't the \"one nation, one election\" concept align with the principles of democratic accountability, where elected representatives are held accountable for their performance, and wouldn't simultaneous elections promote greater accountability and transparency in governance, as envisioned by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 16?"
