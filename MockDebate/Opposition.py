and finnaly generate the speech in the format of the sample speech which i have provided 
and here by format i mean that i want the  speech in the same way the person has written the sample speech, the same kind of human language 




2) Addressing Human trafficking in migrant worker populations

Sir around 70% of all trafficking victims are women and girls.
trafficking in persons has obviously become a major issue and the concerning part about this is many countries have worsening scores in trafficking as per the Organized crime index.

Another surprising issue since we're emphasising on women protection is that Finding number 11 of the UNODC's global report on trafficking in persons 2022 highlighted that women are far more likely to be prosecuted than men.

We obviously support convicting the guilty but why such an imbalance?

Sir regarding prevention of trafficking in persons the solutions are very simple

Firstly for countries with a lot of trafficking incidents, fast track courts should be set up that only hear cases of trafficking in order to expedite the conviction or the release and so that the victim is brought to justice as soon as possible.

Secondly, as I highlighted earlier, we need legislative updates in some member states and in others, we need a major improvement of the executive since the legislature is useless if the executive and judiciary does not work.

To truly assess the damage done every year, member states must carry out thorough surveys and to some extent collaborate with NGOs in order to provide rehabilitation and humanitarian aid to victims.

Even the Joy Ezeilo emphasis in the Special Rapporteur report stated that trafficked persons have a right to an effective remedy for recovery from the ordeal of trafficking and it is an essentialÂ component.



Now i want the same format as the sample speech like sir or other words in human laguage
